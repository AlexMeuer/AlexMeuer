### Hi there 👋

- 🏀 I’m currently working on a new [mentorship platform](https://www.offthecourt.co) with 3 [fantastic cofounders](https://www.linkedin.com/company/offthecourt/).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Perl, because Googling sed/awk commands is a pain, Perl is everywhere, and I should have learnt it years ago.
- ⌨️ NeoVim neophyte, VSCode user, JetBrains alumni.
- 🗯️ [Go](https://golang.org/) is 90% of what I write now.
- 🐠 [fish](https://fishshell.com/) is the superior user-shell (IMO).
- 🖥️ [i3](https://manjaro.org/downloads/community/i3/) lover, [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) appreciator. Tiles > Windows.
